## Front-end Developer Coding Exercise
Hi and welcome! Today you'll be working with an existing codebase to finish a small app that fetches products from a server and displays them on a web page.

Please implement the following:
1. Return an array of product objects that each have a name and price.
2. Connect to the server from the React front-end.
3. Display the products on the web page.
